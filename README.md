# How to Run this compiler ( How to use it )

 first step run this 
```

# How to use output file 

When you run then it will generate the assmebly code of you input.txt file text 


input text file 

![input.txt] (images/)

output file

![output.asm](images/output.png)


# Where have to paste the assemply code 

step 1 : clone the this git repo 
   
   ```
        https://github.com/lightcode/8bit-computer
   ```


step 2: go to folder   ( cd 8bit-computer)

step 3: make a file example.asm or any other name and paste the assembly code generated by  compiler  output.asm  paste it into create d file



```
    python3 ./asm/asm.py tests/example.asm > memory.list
